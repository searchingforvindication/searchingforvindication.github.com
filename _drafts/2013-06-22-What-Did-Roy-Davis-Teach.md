_This is the fourth post in a multi-part series on when Brother Branham became involved with <a href="/tags.html#pentecost-ref">Pentecostal churches</a>._

So far in this series we've discussed Brother Branham being the [pastor of the Pentecostal Tabernacle](/2013/06/19/Where-My-Sorrow-Started/) at the time of Hope's death, evidence that Brother Branham [preached at Pentecostal churches](/2013/06/20/Preaching-At-Pentecostal-Churches/) prior to Hope's death, and provided documented proof that [Roy Davis' church was the First Pentecostal Baptist](/2013/06/21/Roy-Davis/), not a Missionary Baptist church.  In this post, we'll try to gain some insight into the First Pentecostal Baptist church based on information that appeared in his advertisements in the Jeffersonville Evening News.

On January 21, 1933, the church advertisement indicated Dr. Davis would be preaching on "Holy Ghost Power":

The next week's advertisement on January 28, 1933 highlights that Hope Brumbach would be leading the young people's meeting.  In addition, another sister is leading the devotional services:

 On February 3, 1933 the newspaper reported the church announced they had purchased a bus to help bring people to services.  This appeared on the front page of the paper.

 Highlights from the February 4, 1933 advertisement include Hope Brumbach leading the devotional meeting.

 On February 11, 1933, the church celebrated the operation of their new bus, and indicated that "Old-time Pentecostal religion can be enjoyed in our meetings".  Dr. Davis was to speak on "The Devil in the unknown tongue."

 The next advertisement on February 18, 1933 identifies Brother Branham as an elder and indicates he was in charge of the praise service.  This establishes that Brother Branham was part of Dr. Davis congregation in the services leading up to this one.  Dr. Davis spoke on "What is the Pentecostal Religion, and Why Have It?"

 The February 25, 1933 ad mentions a Saturday evening love feast.  In addition, Hope is once again leading the young people's meeting.  Dr. Davis was to speak on the "Holy Ghost Religion."  Notice that this ad states that, "Many are getting to God in our meetings, where the old time Pentecostal power is falling."

 The next church advertisement does not appear until March 11.  This entry indicates that Senior P.B.Y.P.U. will meet under the leadership of Brother Branham, president.  This is the last mention of William Branham in advertisements for the First Pentecostal Baptist Church.

The March 18, 1933 advertisement lists Huette West as the president of P.B.Y.P.U. instead of Brother Branham.  Dr. Davis continued his series on Pentecost.
