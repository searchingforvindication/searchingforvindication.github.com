#### Overloaded With Data

In the course of our research we've collected lots of historical documents and information about Brother Branham and his family.  Some of this was important to our study of the Municipal Bridge Vision, but some turned out to be irrelevant to the topic at hand.  We've been trying to decide the best way to share all of this extra information that we've located.

#### What Type of Data?

We've found marriage licenses, divorce announcements, obituaries, and a few other odds and ends.  For example, while at the National Archives in Atlanta we learned they had a complete collection of World War I draft cards on site.  Since we were already there, we went ahead and photographed Charles Branham's, Frank Broy's, and Charlie Brumbach's.  

We know that lots of people are looking for some of this information right now.  There's certainly a lot more that can be added to what we've collected, but we're going to go ahead and share what we have up to this point.  

#### The Timeline

We've created an [interactive timeline](/timeline.html) that includes embedded pictures, videos, and historic documents.  This timeline is best viewed on a computer or tablet, but it works reasonably well on smart phones.  The idea is that you can navigate through all of these documents and information in chronological order to help put it in context.  

There's a lot of information included on the timeline and we'll be doing some blog posts on some of the items that were important to us.  

This is very much a work in progress and we intend to add additional information and improve this tool as we continue our research.  What we've already collected may help to save others quite a bit of time.
