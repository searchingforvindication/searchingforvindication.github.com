_This is the fifth post in a multi-part series on when Brother Branham became involved with <a href="/tags.html#pentecost-ref">Pentecostal churches</a>._

In our last two posts, we discussed Roy Davis' church, The First Pentecostal Baptist, and provided some information on what was taught there based on newspaper advertisements.  Now we'd like to turn our attention to the beginning of Brother Branham's ministry.  In his own words from _Go Wake Jesus_ preached in Shreveport, Louisiana on November 30, 1963:

>That day down there, about thirty-three years ago, or thirty-four, standing on the banks of the Ohio River there, at the bridge, and about five thousand people or more gathered on the banks. I was just about twenty years old, twenty-three, twenty-two or twenty-three years old, my first revival. I was baptizing five hundred people, that afternoon. And the deacons had led me out in the water. About the seventeenth person, when I was baptizing, I heard a Voice say, "Look up." And I turned to look up. Billy's mother, we wasn't even married then, just going together. Here come that Pillar of Fire, circling out of the bright blue skies, at two o'clock on June the 15th, coming right down out of the skies, like that. And a Voice roared out, all over the place there, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ, you have the Message that'll now forerun the second Coming of Christ."

On May 6, 1933 Roy Davis began to advertise and upcoming tent revival in the Jeffersonville Evening News:

 The upcoming tent revival was advertised again on May 27, 1933:

 <img src="/assets/ChurchAds/19330527BDavis.jpg" alt="Church Tent Revival Advertisement" class="img img-polaroid clearfix" />
 
 The tent revival is not mentioned again in the church's advertisements, so we believe it happened some time shortly after May 27, 1933.  Brother Branham is not mentioned in these advertisements, however, the June 2nd edition of the Jeffersonville Evening News packed this article on the front page:

Is this the 1933 Baptismal service that Brother Branham refers to?  Was Brother Branham's tent meeting the Pentecostal Baptist Church's advertised tent meeting?  This could just be coincidence Roy Davis and Brother Branham had a tent meeting nearly at the same time.  

The location is also of interest.  The Branham Tabernacle is on the corner of 8th and Penn St.  Brother Branham held his tent meeting on the corner of 8th and Pratt.  This was an unoccupied lot in 1933, but now it's the other end of the Branham Tabernacle's parking lot.

Here's a number of quotes where Brother Branham discusses the 1933 Baptism, listed here in chronological order:

From _Baptismal Service, preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on April 9, 1950:
>One of the greatest moments of my life. Looking across somebody's shoulder, my mother. I led her out here in the Ohio River and baptized her in the Name of the Lord Jesus. 

From _God Revealing Himself To His People preached in Cleveland, Ohio on August 13, 1950:
>But It appeared down there on the Ohio River before nearly ten thousand people while I was baptizing in August. I was baptizing some fi--five hundred, I guess, that afternoon. Hundreds of them was standing, and the choir singing, On Jordan's Stormy Banks I Stand. Was about two o'clock. We hadn't had rain for about two weeks.
I had my seventeenth candidate I was taking out in the water. And I raised up, and I asked him if he believed. He had. He would been repented at the meeting? Yes. I raised up my hand, I said, "Father, as I baptize this boy with water, may You baptize him with the Holy Spirit."

>And as I started, Something went, whew [Brother Branham illustrates--Ed.] I looked up. I heard a Voice. Said, "Look up." Thousands standing all over the bank on the Ohio River facing Louisville. Paper carried a big article of it.

From _Believe Ye That I Am Able To Do This_ preached in Cleveland, OH on August 20, 1950:
>When I was baptizing hundreds down at the Ohio River at the foot of Spring Street in Jeffersonville, where thousands were blacked on the bank... At right at two o'clock in the afternoon, I was baptizing the seventeenth person. I started to pray, and thousands standing there looking. And down from the heavens came that green, whirling down like a big star in the distance. When It got close, It was that Light, a Pillar of Fire.

>I think It's the same One that led the children of Israel in the days that went before Moses. And It's in the church today. It's here tonight, the same Pillar of Fire.
When He told me, He said, "As Moses was given two signs to vindicate his ministry, so will you be given two signs. And by these signs, that people will believe." And there It is. I 
And He came down when hundreds and hundreds standing there, people fainted, and fell, and everything. The papers carried a great article, "Mystic star appears over minister at two o'clock in the afternoon while baptizing." There It was.
Friends, settle yourself down. The hour has come. There's been a lot of "playing religion." There's been a lot of playing church. But the hour has come where God's calling out His people. That's right. And He's vindicating it by signs and wonders. And that's it.
And here's the statement. Anyone's welcome to read it. It's here any time, and for anybody. And look at it.

From _My Commission_ preached in Los Angeles, California on May 5, 1951:
>About twelve years ago, I was baptizing my first group after my--one of my revivals at Jeffersonville, Indiana, where I lived at this time--my home is, rather. And standing on the banks of the Ohio River where [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] had gathered out. And while I was baptizing... It was two o'clock in the evening, on June. And the seventeenth candidate, I was baptizing in water at the Ohio River at the foot of Spring Street. And I heard Something speak, and I felt Something take a hold of me. And I looked up. And when I did, coming down from glory came this whirl coming down where I was at.
>"Courier Journal Newspaper" packed an article of it, said, "A mystic star appears over a local Baptist pastor while baptizing in the river." They couldn't make out. Oh, up to probably ten thousand people saw It as It moved down where I was at, and went back up in the skies. Come right where I was and went back up into the sky. Well I... Many asked me what It meant. And I said, "I do not know."

From _Questions and Answers_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on May 15, 1954:
>Just the same thing He said when I baptized right down here on the Ohio River, many of you was standing there, twenty-three years ago, right on the Ohio River that Light, Angel, come right down to where we was at, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent for a forerunner of the first coming of Jesus Christ, your Message will bring the second coming of Jesus Christ." And it's done it. It's... He hasn't come yet, but look what it's done; it's swept the world around. See? And today now, just thinking, the--the effort that's went forth, there's been literally millions...

From _How The Anger Came To Me and His Commission_ preached in Chicago, Illinois on January 17, 1955:
>So then I--then I was getting too critical on speaking with tongues, you see. But one day, then, how God vindicated that to me!

>I was baptizing down on the river, my first converts, at the Ohio River, and the seventeenth person I was baptizing, as I started to baptize him, I said, "Father, as I baptize him with water, You baptize him with the Holy Spirit." I started to--to put him under the water.

>And just then a whirl come from the heavens above, and here come that Light, shining down. Hundreds and hundreds of people on the bank, right at two o'clock in the afternoon, in June. And It hung right over where I was at. A Voice spoke from there, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent for the forerunner of the first coming of Christ, you've got a... have a Message that will bring forth the forerunning of the Second Coming of Christ." And it liked to scared me to death.

>And I went back, and all the people there, the--the foundry men and all them, the druggist, and all of them on the bank. I had baptized about two or three hundred that afternoon. And when they taken me out, pulled me out of the water, the deacons and so forth went up, they asked me, said, "What did that Light mean?"
A big group of colored people from the--the Gilt Edge Baptist church and the Lone Star church down there, and many of those was down there, they begin screaming when they saw that happen, people fainted.

From _The Approach To God_ preached in Chicago, Illinois on January 23, 1955:
 >We were singing that when the Morning Star, the Angel of the Lord made Its first appearance over where I was standing in public, for the first time in my life, at the foot of Spring Street in the Ohio river in June '33, as a young Baptist minister, there baptizing.

From _The Healing of Jairus' Daughter_ preached in Phoenix, Arizona on February 27, 1955:
>I was baptizing them down at the end of Spring Street in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in the Ohio River, when... nearly seven or eight thousand people standing on the bank, bear witness, that two o'clock in the evening, June, 1933, how that a Pillar of Fire come down out of heaven, and hung over where I was standing.
The "Courier Journal," and "The Times News"... no, it was the... [Brother Branham snaps his fingers--Ed.] Oh, I'll get the name of the paper just in a minute, [He snaps his fingers again--Ed.] if I could think of it, the Louisville paper: great article: Mystic Light Appears Over Local Baptist Evangelist While Baptizing At River. Very mystic thing, people could not understand. Many fainted at the Presence of It. The Angel of the Lord come right down and hung over where I was. The "Louisville Herald" is what it was, "Louisville Herald, Herald Post" of Louisville, Kentucky.

From _Witnesses_ preached in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1956:
>Not only that, but I say this: I'm looking down here at the audience now. Here not long ago standing yonder on the Ohio River...?... gone and such unqualified, a poor...?... boy trying to do what thought was right for the Lord Jesus. There before thousands of people, the Pillar of Fire moved from the sky, come down there and said, "As John was sent for a witness before the first coming, this message you'll take will be a witness to the whole world for the second coming. That'll be proven," He said.

How many remembers the Star hanging down here at the Ohio River, many years ago, when He said... Here's a picture of It here yet, when He come down. Said, "Your Message will go forth as a forerunner for the second coming, just like John went forth as a forerunner for the first coming." And look, around the world has swept a revival. Tens of thousands times thousands and thousands, and a great revival...

I can hear the water splash yonder on the Ohio River. When I was a little old boy preacher about twenty-two years old, singing that there, and I heard... Looked up above me and heard a Voice, said, "Look up." Here comes that big Light hanging right yonder, come moving down over me and said, "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ, you'll have a Message that'll forerun the second coming of Christ." Oh, how could I believe it? But it happened just the same. And tonight revival fires are burning around and around the world. The great ransomed Church of God lifted Herself out of that place. And great campaigns of healing, and signs, and wonders, and miracles, showing forth the coming.

My wife, about six months ago, saw It for her first time. She was on the river that day when it appeared down there. When the article went all over the--the English speaking world on the Associated Press: "Mystic Light Appears Over Local Baptist Minister While Baptizing." Stood there... It talked; people heard It talking back and forth. Thousands of people standing there watching me baptize from my first revival--five hundred converts--in the Ohio River... It was in the paper, newspaper clippings; we have it. Got on the Associated Press, Canada got it, all around over the country. "Mystic Light..."

And the papers packed it, "Mystic Light appearing over local Baptist minister," a boy, while baptizing five hundred at the Ohio River. And He said, "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ, this message shall forerun the second." Here we are.

That day down there, about thirty-three years ago, or thirty-four, standing on the banks of the Ohio River there, at the bridge, and about five thousand people or more gathered on the banks. I was just about twenty years old, twenty-three, twenty-two or twenty-three years old, my first revival. I was baptizing five hundred people, that afternoon. And the deacons had led me out in the water. About the seventeenth person, when I was baptizing, I heard a Voice say, "Look up." And I turned to look up. Billy's mother, we wasn't even married then, just going together. Here come that Pillar of Fire, circling out of the bright blue skies, at two o'clock on June the 15th, coming right down out of the skies, like that.

I remember Sister Wilson there when I was called to her bedside dying with TB, hemorrhaging, till the sheets and pillow slips was laying bloody in the corner. I remember the Holy Spirit stopping the blood. A few days afterwards I baptized her in the Ohio River in icy water in the Name of Jesus Christ, and set her in the back of my open car, a little old roadster, and rode her from Utica... Wasn't that right? From... [Sister Wilson speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Yeah. Sister Hope, my wife, Sister there, was in the front seat of a little roadster, and my mother and Sister Snelling in the back. I got their picture, Sister Snelling, mom, and all, Mrs. Weber, Mrs.--my mother-in-law, all of them standing there, and Meda, just a little bitty girl standing out there, and now, gray-headed woman. [A sister speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.]

Then after the fire of God fell on the Ohio River in 1933 a healing revival swept the world, but it never came through any organization. God went outside the Pentecostal groups, outside of organization, and what He is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization, too. God can't work through the dead. He can only work through the LIVING members. Those living members are outside of Babylon.




Another portion of the life story of which we are all familiar is the Ohio River Baptism.  Brother Branham tells us as he was baptising his first converts, from his first revival, before he and Hope were even married the pillar of fire came down over the river.  Brother Branham tells us there were many eye witnesses of this account, and that newspapers carried the article.  
In our research for historical documentation from primary reference sources, we looked for such an article. While we did not fnd, the infamous article we were looking for, you may find what we did locate of interest.  
First, we have copied each quote from the message search using the search "Ohio River" each time Brother Branham refers to this story.  These quotes are placed in chronological order.  
Brother Branham first shares this story on tape in 1950.  As he was baptizing, he heard a voice tell him to "look up".  The numbers of people and witnesses vary per quote from hunderds upon hundreds to thousands, and when he was asked what this light meant, Brother Branham states, " I do not know". 
 It is not until 1954 that Brother Branham tells us there was a voice with the light.  That voice told him, "As John the Baptist was sent for a forerunner of the first coming of Jesus Christ, your Message will bring the second coming of Jesus Christ." 
You may read the following quotes for each account of the Ohio River Baptism. Following we have included the June news articles coinsiding with this story.
