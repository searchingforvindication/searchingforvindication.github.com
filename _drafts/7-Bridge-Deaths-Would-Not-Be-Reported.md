#### The Deaths Would Not Have Been Reported

In a recent [Catch The Vision](http://branham.org/content/ctv/CTV2012_02_UPDATE/CTV2012_02_UPDATE.pdf#zoom=100) publication, Voice of God Recordings states that:

> "Besides that, a few deaths on a local bridge construction project would not have been big news in that era anyway. If it was reported, it probably would have been an article buried inside the local newspaper."

We decided to explore this idea by examining how a previous bridge construction accident was treated by the press.

#### The Big Four Bridge Construction Accident

On December 15, 1893 during the construction of the Big Four Railroad bridge over the Ohio river a [terrible tragedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_Bridge#Construction) occurred.  A number of men fell to their deaths and drowned.  The event was reported the very next day in the Jeffersonville Evening News:

If you're interested in reading the entire article for yourself, here's a PDF of the [top half of the article](/assets/Bridge/18931215c.pdf), and the [bottom half](/assets/Bridge/18931215d.pdf).

The next day, the paper ran another story that included the names of the dead, injured, and missing.  Again, if you care to see this for yourself, PDF scans of the top of the article are [here](/assets/Bridge/18931216c.pdf), and the bottom of the article can be found [here](/assets/Bridge/18931216d.pdf).

Across the river, the Courier Journal also had a front page spread that covered the bridge:

We have full page scans of this article available [here](/assets/Bridge/CJ18931216.pdf).  The scans of this article are very challenging to read.  Unfortunately, the quality of the scanning equipment at the Louisville Free Public Library is inferior to what is available at the Indiana State Library. 

#### Did Papers Outside of the Immediate Area Carry This News In The Days After The Accident?

The very next day this event was reported in The Evening Bulletin in Maysville, KY:

<img src="/assets/Bridge/BigFour4Maysville.jpg" alt="Front Page Article regarding the bridge from Maysville, KY" class="img img-polaroid" />

There’s a couple things that are very interesting about this article.  First, the distance between Louisville and Maysville where this article was published is about 110 miles (177 KM).  It’s pretty incredible that less than 24 hours after the accident, this event appeared on the front page of a small paper so far away.  Further, it fills a full two-columns of the paper and includes many details about the accident, including a list of names of the dead, injured, and missing workers.

#### What Other Papers Carried the Big Four Accident?

After finding this article from Maysville, we decided to see what other papers carried this or similar stories on December 16, 1893.  As it turns out, the Louisville Big Four Bridge Accident was national news carried by major papers around the country.  

The [New York Tribune](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1893-12-16/ed-1/seq-1/) packed it:

<img src="/assets/Bridge/BigFour5NY.jpg" alt="New York Tribune article on Big Four Accident" class="img img-polaroid" />

The [St. Paul Daily Globe](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1893-12-16/ed-1/seq-1/) packed it:

<img src="/assets/Bridge/BigFour6STP.jpg" alt="St. Paul Daily Globe article on Big Four Accident" class="img img-polaroid" />

The [Los Angeles Herald](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042461/1893-12-16/ed-1/seq-1/) packed it:

<img src="/assets/Bridge/BigFour7LA.jpg" alt="Los Angeles Herald article on Big Four Accident" class="img img-polaroid" />

There were many more papers that carried this article.  A quick search on the Library of Congress [Chronicling America Collection]((http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) for December 15-16, 1893 yields many other results.

#### Summary

The Big Four Railroad Bridge accident was front page news on a national level in 1893.  Within 24 hours newspapers from coast-to-coast carried large articles on their front pages that included many details about the accident including the names of the lives lost.  We can safely say that a similar accident in 1928 or 1929 less than a mile down the river from this previous event would have certainly been front page news on the local, regional, and likely the national level.
