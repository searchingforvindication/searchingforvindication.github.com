McEwen's death was due to a broken neck, Coroner Asa D. Combs, reported Wednesday.  The man also sustained a broken back, broken left arm and lacerations on his head.  Workmen who saw the man plunge to his death reported that he was working on the floor of the bridge and apparently made a misstep, losing his balance.  McEwen's death marks the second to occur since the beginning of the bridge more than a year ago.  <a href="/assets/Bridge/19290911B.pdf">Enlarged version</a>
