_This is the ninth post in a multi-part series on when Brother Branham became involved with <a href="/tags.html#pentecost-ref">Pentecostal churches</a>._

In our [last post](/2013/06/28/History-Of-Roy-Davis-Church) we reviewed the history of when Roy Davis' acquired his church in Jeffersonville and when the property was transferred out of his name.  In this post, we examine why Dr. Davis may have left Jeffersonville.

The last advertisement for the Pentecostal Baptist Church appeared in the Jeffersonville Evening News on February 10, 1934.  Just a short time later, on March 30, 1934 the Jeffersonville Evening News reported that Roy Davis was suing the executor of an estate to set aside the first will of Laura Eaken in favor of a second will that named Davis as the sole beneficiary of her estate.

Just a few months after this first public legal battle, the lot at 328 Watt Street was transferred from the church to Roy Davis' son.  The deed indicates there was no longer a church on the lot at this time.  We know that something happened to Roy Davis' church between February 10 and May 10, 1934.  During this same time frame, Roy Davis was involved in a legal battle where he was trying to lay claim to being the sole beneficiary of an estate.
