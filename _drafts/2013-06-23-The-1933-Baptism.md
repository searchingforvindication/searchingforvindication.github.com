_This is the fifth post in a multi-part series on when Brother Branham became involved with <a href="/tags.html#pentecost-ref">Pentecostal churches</a>._

In our last two posts, we discussed Roy Davis' church, The First Pentecostal Baptist, and provided some information on what was taught there based on newspaper advertisements.  Now we'd like to turn our attention to the beginning of Brother Branham's ministry.  In his own words from _Go Wake Jesus_ preached in Shreveport, Louisiana on November 30, 1963:

>That day down there, about thirty-three years ago, or thirty-four, standing on the banks of the Ohio River there, at the bridge, and about five thousand people or more gathered on the banks. I was just about twenty years old, twenty-three, twenty-two or twenty-three years old, my first revival. I was baptizing five hundred people, that afternoon. And the deacons had led me out in the water. About the seventeenth person, when I was baptizing, I heard a Voice say, "Look up." And I turned to look up. Billy's mother, we wasn't even married then, just going together. Here come that Pillar of Fire, circling out of the bright blue skies, at two o'clock on June the 15th, coming right down out of the skies, like that. And a Voice roared out, all over the place there, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ, you have the Message that'll now forerun the second Coming of Christ."

On May 6, 1933 Roy Davis began to advertise and upcoming tent revival in the Jeffersonville Evening News:

 The upcoming tent revival was advertised again on May 27, 1933:

 <img src="/assets/ChurchAds/19330527BDavis.jpg" alt="Church Tent Revival Advertisement" class="img img-polaroid clearfix" />
 
 The tent revival is not mentioned again in the church's advertisements, so we believe it happened some time shortly after May 27, 1933.  Brother Branham is not mentioned in these advertisements, however, the June 2nd edition of the Jeffersonville Evening News packed this article on the front page:
 
 <img src="/assets/ChurchAds/1933Baptism.jpg" alt="1933 Baptism" class="img img-polaroid clearfix" />

Is this the 1933 Baptismal service that Brother Branham refers to?  Was Brother Branham's tent meeting the Pentecostal Baptist Church's advertised tent meeting?  This could just be coincidence Roy Davis and Brother Branham had a tent meeting nearly at the same time.  

The location is also of interest.  The Branham Tabernacle is on the corner of 8th and Penn St.  Brother Branham held his tent meeting on the corner of 8th and Pratt.  This was an unoccupied lot in 1933, but now it's the other end of the Branham Tabernacle's parking lot.

Here's a number of quotes where Brother Branham discusses the 1933 Baptism, listed here in chronological order:

**From _Gifts And Callings Are Without Repentance_ preached in Carlsbad, New Mexico in March, 1950:**
>After while, I met up with the Full Gospel people. And I... Just before then, I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then look like it just kept coming more and more. And then it, He appeared on the river, one time when I was  baptizing  before probably ten thousand people, like a great morning star came down where I was standing. Thousands seen It. He went back right into the heavens.

**From _God Revealing Himself To His People_ preached in Cleveland, Ohio on August 13, 1950:**
>But It appeared down there on the Ohio River before nearly ten thousand people while I was baptizing in August. I was baptizing some fi--five hundred, I guess, that afternoon. Hundreds of them was standing, and the choir singing, On Jordan's Stormy Banks I Stand. Was about two o'clock. We hadn't had rain for about two weeks.

>I had my seventeenth candidate I was taking out in the water. And I raised up, and I asked him if he believed. He had. He would been repented at the meeting? Yes. I raised up my hand, I said, "Father, as I baptize this boy with water, may You baptize him with the Holy Spirit."

>And as I started, Something went, whew [Brother Branham illustrates--Ed.] I looked up. I heard a Voice. Said, "Look up." Thousands standing all over the bank on the Ohio River facing Louisville. Paper carried a big article of it.

>And I looked, coming right down out of the heavens, out of a place about as big as this platform, where the blue skies churning like waters... Coming right down out of there came a big thing, like a star, whirling around, going, whew \[Brother Branham illustrates--Ed.\], coming right down visibly before the eyes. Moved right down, looked like a star at a distance. When it got close, It looked like a milling fire of Light, moving right down and stood over where I was. Then went right back up into the heavens again. The waters let up.

>I've often wondered if that wasn't the Angel that was on the waters (See?) in Bethesda, you know. Went away...

>And papers carried a big article, "Mysterious Star Appears Over Minister While Baptizing." And on down, It kept coming.


**From _Believe Ye That I Am Able To Do This_ preached in Cleveland, Ohio on August 20, 1950:**
>When I was baptizing hundreds down at the Ohio River at the foot of Spring Street in Jeffersonville, where thousands were blacked on the bank... At right at two o'clock in the afternoon, I was baptizing the seventeenth person. I started to pray, and thousands standing there looking. And down from the heavens came that green, whirling down like a big star in the distance. When It got close, It was that Light, a Pillar of Fire.
>I think It's the same One that led the children of Israel in the days that went before Moses. And It's in the church today. It's here tonight, the same Pillar of Fire.
 
>When He told me, He said, "As Moses was given two signs to vindicate his ministry, so will you be given two signs. And by these signs, that people will believe." And there It is. I believe It's the same Angel of the covenant.
>And He came down when hundreds and hundreds standing there, people fainted, and fell, and everything. The papers carried a great article, "Mystic star appears over minister at two o'clock in the afternoon while baptizing." There It was.

**From _My Commission_ preached in Los Angeles, California on May 5, 1951:**
>About twelve years ago, I was baptizing my first group after my--one of my revivals at Jeffersonville, Indiana, where I lived at this time--my home is, rather. And standing on the banks of the Ohio River where [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] had gathered out. And while I was baptizing... It was two o'clock in the evening, on June. And the seventeenth candidate, I was baptizing in water at the Ohio River at the foot of Spring Street. And I heard Something speak, and I felt Something take a hold of me. And I looked up. And when I did, coming down from glory came this whirl coming down where I was at.
>"Courier Journal Newspaper" packed an article of it, said, "A mystic star appears over a local Baptist pastor while baptizing in the river." They couldn't make out. Oh, up to probably ten thousand people saw It as It moved down where I was at, and went back up in the skies. Come right where I was and went back up into the sky. Well I... Many asked me what It meant. And I said, "I do not know."

**From _Do You Now Believe_ preached in Battle Creek, Michigan on August 17, 1952:**
>Recently when I was  baptizing  on the  river  at Jeffersonville, when all the local newspapers packed It, two o'clock in the afternoon when I was praying, here It come right down out of the heavens, right at two o'clock in the evening, June, or in the afternoon, rather, in June, about the middle of June, hung right over where I was, and a Voice from It, saying, "As John the Baptist was sent to warn the people of the first coming of Christ, so is this Message to warn the people of the second coming."

>Right back up into the heavens, when people screamed, fainted. What is it? God, getting the Church ready. You don't need no new doctrine. You don't need no new theories. You need real true hearts to Almighty God, to believe on God, and His Son, Christ Jesus. Have fellowship with everybody, all the Christians, by the Holy Spirit. Amen.

**From _The Pillar Of Fire_ preached in Jonesboro, Arkansas preached on May 9, 1953:**
>And He... When I was--I was a young Baptist preacher baptizing my first converts, five hundred of them down on the  river , my first revival... I had about three thousand attend at the revival. And my education was so poor, till my girlfriend read the Bible while I preached. That's right. It's not much better tonight. But God's not known by education. God's known by faith. God's not known by knowledge.

**From _The Angel Of The Covenant_ preached in Phoenix, Arizona on March 1, 1954:**
>It was seen on the  river  there when I was just a boy,  baptizing  my first group in the Baptist church: Five hundred, one afternoon, at the foot of Spring Street in Jeffersonville. The newspapers packed an article of it: A Mystic Light Appears Over Local Baptist Minister While  Baptizing  At The  River .

**From _Why I'm Praying For The Sick_ preached in Columbus, Ohio on March 14, 1954:**
>One night while in prayer, away, there was a Man come walking to me on the floor. And I seen Him; this was not a vision. It was the Man. I'd heard His voice many times, saw Him when I baptized at the  river , and I was first ordained a Baptist minister. Had my revival, baptized five hundred, my converts, after a two weeks meeting at the foot of Spring Street. And right there all the local papers packed the article of it: "Mystic Light Hangs Over Minister While Baptizing." And It can't... It was like a Pillar of Fire. And It hung down there and they...

>And then, the people asked me about It, and they got me scared, and told me It was the devil. And one night while I was in prayer... Many years later, just before coming to the Full Gospel people, I was praying, "God, take this thing away from me." I said, "Lord, You know I love You, and I don't want It no more, please." I went to pray all night about it. And I heard someone walking. I looked coming over to this side; there come a tall Man, big, long hair. Now, it didn't look like the picture of Jesus. I believe, I say this reverently. I believe, by vision, I seen Jesus twice. I--I--I... It was a little Man, but it doesn't look much like the artist paints Him. But I--I fainted when He--looked at Him, so I... it was... He was standing off to my side.

**From _Sirs We Would See Jesus_ preached in Louisville, Kentucky on March 28, 1954:**
>So then, I--I--I have never feared. I've just went humbly to preach the Gospel. As God sent me to do this. And the things that I speak of right here... Even in one of your papers here not long ago, the old "Louisville Herald," I believe it was, or something like that, declared the article when it was down here on the river, and that Light come down and hung over where I was at, when I was baptizing, a young minister many years ago out across the country.

**From _Questions and Answers_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on May 15, 1954:**
>Just the same thing He said when I baptized right down here on the Ohio River, many of you was standing there, twenty-three years ago, right on the Ohio River that Light, Angel, come right down to where we was at, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent for a forerunner of the first coming of Jesus Christ, your Message will bring the second coming of Jesus Christ." And it's done it. It's... He hasn't come yet, but look what it's done; it's swept the world around. See? And today now, just thinking, the--the effort that's went forth, there's been literally millions...

**From _The Deep Calleth To The Deep_ preached in Washington, DC on June 24, 1954:**
>And now, they--you look in there, and you'll see another picture of It where It settled down, and a newspaper photographer caught that one at Camden Arkansas. But it wasn't authentic like this American Association. And they--they got it, and it was--then it became authentic.

>So we--and many thousands of people... I was standing on the  river  here some time ago baptizing five hundred after a revival, and It come right down where I was standing. And people fainted and--just there where It was. And It was just like a roaring noise, a whipping fire. I pray that God will come visible before the audience tonight in that manner here at the capital once more, if I can find favor with God...

**From _Everlasting Life And How To Receive It_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on December 31, 1954:**
>Sometime ago, as a young minister, when my first revival come, I had it over here on the corner, where this housing project in a tent. I was  baptizing  a group down at the  river  that Sunday afternoon, when the Angel of the Lord made His first appearance in public in a vindication of the Message that I was to speak. And It was a Light came down from heaven and stood there. People are perhaps in the tabernacle tonight, who stood and seen that Light. And I started forth, telling it, and so forth. And all you know how the story goes, and on and on. And people sometime would walk away, and say, "That's just imagination." They'd leave a meeting where people would see It, and walk away, say, "I saw It." Others say, "Well, I didn't see It." Now, of course, God lets see who He wants to see.


**From _How The Anger Came To Me and His Commission_ preached in Chicago, Illinois on January 17, 1955:**
>So then I--then I was getting too critical on speaking with tongues, you see. But one day, then, how God vindicated that to me!

>I was baptizing down on the river, my first converts, at the Ohio River, and the seventeenth person I was baptizing, as I started to baptize him, I said, "Father, as I baptize him with water, You baptize him with the Holy Spirit." I started to--to put him under the water.

>And just then a whirl come from the heavens above, and here come that Light, shining down. Hundreds and hundreds of people on the bank, right at two o'clock in the afternoon, in June. And It hung right over where I was at. A Voice spoke from there, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent for the forerunner of the first coming of Christ, you've got a... have a Message that will bring forth the forerunning of the Second Coming of Christ." And it liked to scared me to death.

>And I went back, and all the people there, the--the foundry men and all them, the druggist, and all of them on the bank. I had baptized about two or three hundred that afternoon. And when they taken me out, pulled me out of the water, the deacons and so forth went up, they asked me, said, "What did that Light mean?"

>A big group of colored people from the--the Gilt Edge Baptist church and the Lone Star church down there, and many of those was down there, they begin screaming when they saw that happen, people fainted.

**From _The Approach To God_ preached in Chicago, Illinois on January 23, 1955:**
>We were singing that when the Morning Star, the Angel of the Lord made Its first appearance over where I was standing in public, for the first time in my life, at the foot of Spring Street in the Ohio river in June '33, as a young Baptist minister, there baptizing.

**From _The Healing of Jairus' Daughter_ preached in Phoenix, Arizona on February 27, 1955:**
>I was baptizing them down at the end of Spring Street in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in the Ohio River, when... nearly seven or eight thousand people standing on the bank, bear witness, that two o'clock in the evening, June, 1933, how that a Pillar of Fire come down out of heaven, and hung over where I was standing.

>The "Courier Journal," and "The Times News"... no, it was the... \[Brother Branham snaps his fingers--Ed.\] Oh, I'll get the name of the paper just in a minute, [He snaps his fingers again--Ed.] if I could think of it, the Louisville paper: great article: Mystic Light Appears Over Local Baptist Evangelist While Baptizing At River. Very mystic thing, people could not understand. Many fainted at the Presence of It. The Angel of the Lord come right down and hung over where I was. The "Louisville Herald" is what it was, "Louisville Herald, Herald Post" of Louisville, Kentucky.

**From _Blind Bartimaeus_ preached in Alberta, Canada in April, 1955:**
>And then on the  river , when I was first ordained in the Baptist church (twenty-three-year-old boy, or, man), God come down that day when I was  baptizing  five hundred at the  river , and appeared in that same Light. The papers packed articles of it. And then later on, they said, "Oh, well, it might have been psychology."

>When It come into the meetings and people, some people so close to God, or, may it not been that, may it was for them. Some people can see things and some doesn't see things.

**From _Enticing Spirits_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on July 24, 1955:**
>Won't you come and go along? I remember when about five hundred of us standing yonder when I was  baptizing  a hundred and twenty, about this time of year, down here on the banks of the  river , when that great Morning Star come shining there on the  river . Hallelujah! A voice speaking from It, said, "Someday you'll spread the Gospel throughout the world."

>I said, "A poor, little, ignorant farm boy will never do that. It's the grace of God." Amen. Oh, who will come and go? Get rid of, lay aside every weight now. Don't listen to those enticing spirits. Come, listen to the Word of God, THUS SAITH THE LORD. "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled."

**From _The True And False Vines_ preached in Shreveport, Louisiana on March 11, 1956:**
>I'd just been ordained in the Baptist church, about--about two weeks and had a revival there in the city, lasted for two weeks. And we was  baptizing  five hundred converts on the  river  that afternoon when the Angel of the Lord come visible. The newspapers and things picked it up, and so forth: twenty-three years ago. And the voice that He spoke from there, it has done just exactly what He said He would do.

**From _Witnesses_ preached in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1956:**
>Not only that, but I say this: I'm looking down here at the audience now. Here not long ago standing yonder on the Ohio River...?... gone and such unqualified, a poor...?... boy trying to do what thought was right for the Lord Jesus. There before thousands of people, the Pillar of Fire moved from the sky, come down there and said, "As John was sent for a witness before the first coming, this message you'll take will be a witness to the whole world for the second coming. That'll be proven," He said.

**From _God Keeps His Word_ preached in Sturgis, Michigan on January 15, 1957:**
>About ten years before that, about--about fifteen, nearly ten or fifteen years before that, when I was just a young Baptist preacher, no more than a boy, baptizing out there in the river, hundreds of people that afternoon, my first revival; and that Light come down from heaven and stood there before thousands of people. They fainted and everything, years ago when I was baptizing. And a Voice spoke from there and said that I would take a message around the world, which would start a revival just like that it did in the days of John the Baptist before the second coming of Christ. I knowed a bit more about it than nothing. I wrote it down and kept it. They kept it. The newspapers had it, and everything. "Mystic Light Appears Over Local Baptist Boy, Pastor, While He's A Baptizing In The Water," and all about it.

**From _Questions And Answers On Hebrews 2_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on October 2, 1957:**
>How many remembers the Star hanging down here at the Ohio River, many years ago, when He said... Here's a picture of It here yet, when He come down. Said, "Your Message will go forth as a forerunner for the second coming, just like John went forth as a forerunner for the first coming." And look, around the world has swept a revival. Tens of thousands times thousands and thousands, and a great revival...

**From _Faith_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on December 29, 1957:**
>And right yonder on the  river , many, many, many years ago, when we was baptizing from my first little revival, there where this Angel of the Lord here, come down and hung over where we was at, and He said to me this message will go around the world, and would start a revival that'll sweep around the world, and it'll be just before the coming of Christ the second time. 

>And when the--Brother Davis, Doctor Roy Davis, many of you know him, who ordained me into the church, into the Baptist Church, when he said I had a nightmare, how would I, with a seventh grade education go and preach to kings and potentates and monarchs around the world.

**From _God Called Man_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on October 5, 1958:**
>How many's still living, when It first appeared before mankind down here on the  river  when I was baptizing them hundreds down there that day, in the building, raise up your hand. There's three or four hands: still living from years ago down here on the  river  when It come down, and the message of the Lord came: still just the same. Did It do just what It said there, that the ministry I would be preaching would start a revival around the world just before the second coming of Christ? Look what it's done. See?

**From _What Was The Holy Ghost Given For_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on December 17, 1959:**
>I can hear the water splash yonder on the Ohio River. When I was a little old boy preacher about twenty-two years old, singing that there, and I heard... Looked up above me and heard a Voice, said, "Look up." Here comes that big Light hanging right yonder, come moving down over me and said, "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ, you'll have a Message that'll forerun the second coming of Christ." Oh, how could I believe it? But it happened just the same. And tonight revival fires are burning around and around the world. The great ransomed Church of God lifted Herself out of that place. And great campaigns of healing, and signs, and wonders, and miracles, showing forth the coming.
 
 **From _The Revelation That Was Given To Me_ preached in San Juan, Puerto Rico on February 10, 1960:**
>Then when I was converted, I joined the Baptist church, started preaching the Gospel, right away. The Lord blessed greatly, and I had my first revival, a two weeks revival, five hundred came to the Lord. I taken them down at the  river  to baptize them. And while they was around ten thousand on the bank, watching... It was real dry, no rain for two or three weeks. People were praying for rain. And when I was baptizing the seventeenth convert, I heard a Voice, said, 
 
>"Look up." It scared me. I was just a young boy.

>The girl that I later married, was taking pictures on the bank. I heard It again; said, "Look up." And I was afraid to look up. Everyone on the bank was wondering what I was hesitating about. All--many peoples up and down the banks of the  river ... Newspaper photographers... And then It said again, "Look up." And I looked up, and as I looked up, here come that Light coming down. People begin fainting, falling, and a Voice came that shook all around the place there, said, "As John, the Baptist, was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ, the Message that is given you will be a forerunning of the second coming of Christ." Not that I would be a forerunner, but the Message was the forerunning. I'm no more than no one else. It's the Christ we're speaking of. Then I--them visions started coming to me more than ever.  E-9     Now, that newspaper went on to Associated Press. It went all the way into Canada, and all through... We have the clippings of it yet. Said, "A mystic Light appears over a local Baptist minister while..."

My wife, about six months ago, saw It for her first time. She was on the river that day when it appeared down there. When the article went all over the--the English speaking world on the Associated Press: "Mystic Light Appears Over Local Baptist Minister While Baptizing." Stood there... It talked; people heard It talking back and forth. Thousands of people standing there watching me baptize from my first revival--five hundred converts--in the Ohio River... It was in the paper, newspaper clippings; we have it. Got on the Associated Press, Canada got it, all around over the country. "Mystic Light..."

And the papers packed it, "Mystic Light appearing over local Baptist minister," a boy, while baptizing five hundred at the Ohio River. And He said, "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ, this message shall forerun the second." Here we are.

That day down there, about thirty-three years ago, or thirty-four, standing on the banks of the Ohio River there, at the bridge, and about five thousand people or more gathered on the banks. I was just about twenty years old, twenty-three, twenty-two or twenty-three years old, my first revival. I was baptizing five hundred people, that afternoon. And the deacons had led me out in the water. About the seventeenth person, when I was baptizing, I heard a Voice say, "Look up." And I turned to look up. Billy's mother, we wasn't even married then, just going together. Here come that Pillar of Fire, circling out of the bright blue skies, at two o'clock on June the 15th, coming right down out of the skies, like that. And a Voice roared out, all over the place there, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ, you have the Message that'll now forerun the second Coming of Christ."

I remember Sister Wilson there when I was called to her bedside dying with TB, hemorrhaging, till the sheets and pillow slips was laying bloody in the corner. I remember the Holy Spirit stopping the blood. A few days afterwards I baptized her in the Ohio River in icy water in the Name of Jesus Christ, and set her in the back of my open car, a little old roadster, and rode her from Utica... Wasn't that right? From... [Sister Wilson speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Yeah. Sister Hope, my wife, Sister there, was in the front seat of a little roadster, and my mother and Sister Snelling in the back. I got their picture, Sister Snelling, mom, and all, Mrs. Weber, Mrs.--my mother-in-law, all of them standing there, and Meda, just a little bitty girl standing out there, and now, gray-headed woman. [A sister speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.]

Then after the fire of God fell on the Ohio River in 1933 a healing revival swept the world, but it never came through any organization. God went outside the Pentecostal groups, outside of organization, and what He is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization, too. God can't work through the dead. He can only work through the LIVING members. Those living members are outside of Babylon.




Another portion of the life story of which we are all familiar is the Ohio River Baptism.  Brother Branham tells us as he was baptising his first converts, from his first revival, before he and Hope were even married the pillar of fire came down over the river.  Brother Branham tells us there were many eye witnesses of this account, and that newspapers carried the article.  
In our research for historical documentation from primary reference sources, we looked for such an article. While we did not fnd, the infamous article we were looking for, you may find what we did locate of interest.  
First, we have copied each quote from the message search using the search "Ohio River" each time Brother Branham refers to this story.  These quotes are placed in chronological order.  
Brother Branham first shares this story on tape in 1950.  As he was baptizing, he heard a voice tell him to "look up".  The numbers of people and witnesses vary per quote from hunderds upon hundreds to thousands, and when he was asked what this light meant, Brother Branham states, " I do not know". 
 It is not until 1954 that Brother Branham tells us there was a voice with the light.  That voice told him, "As John the Baptist was sent for a forerunner of the first coming of Jesus Christ, your Message will bring the second coming of Jesus Christ." 
You may read the following quotes for each account of the Ohio River Baptism. Following we have included the June news articles coinsiding with this story.
