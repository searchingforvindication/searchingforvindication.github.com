_This is the sixth post in a multi-part series on when Brother Branham became involved with <a href="/tags.html#pentecost-ref">Pentecostal churches</a>._



In his own words from _Go Wake Jesus_ preached in Shreveport, Louisiana on November 30, 1963:

>That day down there, about thirty-three years ago, or thirty-four, standing on the banks of the Ohio River there, at the bridge, and about five thousand people or more gathered on the banks. I was just about twenty years old, twenty-three, twenty-two or twenty-three years old, my first revival. I was baptizing five hundred people, that afternoon. And the deacons had led me out in the water. About the seventeenth person, when I was baptizing, I heard a Voice say, "Look up." And I turned to look up. Billy's mother, we wasn't even married then, just going together. Here come that Pillar of Fire, circling out of the bright blue skies, at two o'clock on June the 15th, coming right down out of the skies, like that. And a Voice roared out, all over the place there, and said, "As John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ, you have the Message that'll now forerun the second Coming of Christ."

On May 6, 1933 Roy Davis began to advertise and upcoming tent revival in the Jeffersonville Evening News:

 The upcoming tent revival was advertised again on May 27, 1933:

 The tent revival is not mentioned again in the church's advertisements, so we believe it happened some time shortly after May 27, 1933.  Brother Branham is not mentioned in these advertisements, however, the June 2nd edition of the Jeffersonville Evening News packed this article on the front page:

Is this the 1933 Baptismal service that Brother Branham refers to?  Was Brother Branham's tent meeting the Pentecostal Baptist Church's advertised tent meeting?  This could just be coincidence Roy Davis and Brother Branham had a tent meeting nearly at the same time.  

The location is also of interest.  The Branham Tabernacle is on the corner of 8th and Penn St.  Brother Branham held his tent meeting on the corner of 8th and Pratt.  This was an unoccupied lot in 1933, but now it's the other end of the Branham Tabernacle's parking lot.

Another portion of the life story of which we are all familiar is the Ohio River Baptism.  Brother Branham tells us as he was baptising his first converts, from his first revival, before he and Hope were even married the pillar of fire came down over the river.  Brother Branham tells us there were many eye witnesses of this account, and that newspapers carried the article.  
In our research for historical documentation from primary reference sources, we looked for such an article. While we did not fnd, the infamous article we were looking for, you may find what we did locate of interest.  
First, we have copied each quote from the message search using the search "Ohio River" each time Brother Branham refers to this story.  These quotes are placed in chronological order.  
Brother Branham first shares this story on tape in 1950.  As he was baptizing, he heard a voice tell him to "look up".  The numbers of people and witnesses vary per quote from hunderds upon hundreds to thousands, and when he was asked what this light meant, Brother Branham states, " I do not know". 
 It is not until 1954 that Brother Branham tells us there was a voice with the light.  That voice told him, "As John the Baptist was sent for a forerunner of the first coming of Jesus Christ, your Message will bring the second coming of Jesus Christ." 
You may read the following quotes for each account of the Ohio River Baptism. Following we have included the June news articles coinsiding with this story.
