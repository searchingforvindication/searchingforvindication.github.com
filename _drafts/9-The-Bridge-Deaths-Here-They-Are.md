_This is the ninth post in a multi-part series on the <a href="/tags.html#bridge-ref">Municipal Bridge Vision</a>._

Brother Branham indicates that he saw a vision of sixteen men falling from the Municipal Bridge and loosing their lives.  He indicates in several quotes that the men drowned.  It's also clear that this tragedy occurred during the construction of the bridge. 

On the other hand, former believers claim that there is no evidence that ANY lives were lost during the construction of the bridge.  

We discovered that neither view was completely accurate.

#### Bridge Death #1

On Wednesday, June 19, 1929 Richard Pilton died after being hit in the temple with an iron crank.  He was in a barge near pier number 5.  He did not drown.

Here's a [PDF scan](/assets/Bridge/19290620B.pdf) of the front page of the Jeffersonville Evening News from June 19, 1929 for your review.

There's a couple key points to note:

* The article clearly states that this was the first fatality associated with the bridge.
* The article indicates that the bridge construction project had a formal safety program whose effectiveness was touted because this was the first and only serious accident associated with the project.

#### Bridge Death #2

The second death related to the bridge construction was on September 10, 1929.  Lloyd McEwen from Bruce, Wisconsin lost his footing and fell, landing on a barge below the bridge.  He did not drown, but rather, broke his neck, back, and arm.  He also had lacerations on his head.  The newspaper article documenting his death specifically lists him as the second death to occur since construction began.

Here's a PDF Scan of the [top of the page](/assets/Bridge/19290911.pdf) of the Jeffersonville Evening News from September 11, 1929.  The article is on the second half of the page near the bottom and the bottom of it is cut off in this scan.  Here's a [second scan](/assets/Bridge/19290911B.pdf) of just the lower portion of the page.

Note that the article indicates:

* The man did not drown.
* He fell into a barge, not the river itself.
* This is clearly the second death to occur since construction began.
* 

#### Were There Any Other Deaths?

The bridge opened on October 31, 1929 and no further fatalities occurred between September 10th and October 31.  We checked through December 31, 1929 just to make sure we didn't miss anything.  The bridge opened ahead of schedule and under budget.

#### Summary

Did sixteen men fall off of the Municipal Bridge during it's construction and lose their lives?  No.  Historical records prove that exactly two men died during the construction of the bridge in two separate accidents.  Neither drowned.

We discovered that only two men had died during the construction in our first visit to the Indiana State Library.  To say this grieved us would be an understatement.  We challenged our own research and reviewed the material we unearthed many times.  We continued our research and obtained a copy of the official engineer's report to the Municipal Bridge Commission.  In addition, we made a second trip to the Indiana State Library to re-review our findings and search for additional evidence.  It's discouraging to us to believe that this did not happen.  

For those who continue to believe that this vision was fulfilled during the construction of the Municipal Bridge as Brother Branham said, we will continue to post additional evidence in the coming days.
