_This is the third post in a multi-part series on the <a href="/tags.html#bridge-ref">Municipal Bridge Vision</a>._

#### Available Sources Used In Our Research

There are many resources available to help us understand this vision and set them into historical context.  The following were used extensively in our research:

*  Brother Branham’s own verbal and transcribed [accounts](/2013/02/16/What-Did-Brother-Branham-Say-About-The-Bridge/) regarding the vision and its fulfillment.  These can be accessed using “The Table” software from Voice Of God Recordings, or directly from the [http://branham.org](http://branham.org) website.  
*  Account from the [Voice Of Healing magazine](http://www.godsgenerals.com/pdf/1948-1950_april.pdf).
*  Brother Pearry Green’s recent sermons on his personal testimonies regarding the bridge vision
* Owen Jorgensen’s “Supernatural” books.
* Basic internet searches on Google and other search engines.
* [Wikipedia.org](http://Wikipedia.org)
* [Encyclopedia of Louisville](http://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC&lpg=PA124&ots=byz9wSRhUi&dq=Bridging%20the%20ohio%20carl%20kramer&pg=PA123#v=onepage&q&f=false)
* March 2007 Louisville Magazine [article](http://www.loumag.com/articledisplay.aspx?id=36106759) on the construction of the bridge.
* National Register of Historic Places Louisville Municipal Bridge [Nomination Form](http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/84001578.pdf)
*  Official Engineer’s report to the Louisville Municipal Bridge Commission.  
* [Kentucky Newspapers microfiche collection](http://www.lfpl.org/newspapers.htm#kentucky) at the Louisville Free Public Library.
* [Clark County Newspaper microfiche collection](http://www.in.gov/library/2813.htm) at the Indiana State Library in Indianapolis, IN
* Library Of Congress, [Chronicling America collection](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/).

We started by performing as much research as possible via the Internet.  Through this research we learned of the existence of an official engineering report to the bridge commission which we felt might have some important details about the bridge construction.  Copies of this historic document are housed at a few university libraries.  A copy is also available for examination at the main branch of the Louisville Free Public Library in downtown Louisville, KY.  This library also contains an extensive collection of Kentucky newspapers on microfiche.

By far, the most valuable resource we discovered was the [Indiana State Library](http://www.in.gov/library/).  This facility contains a very complete record of Indiana history and has one of the largest and most complete genealogy collections in the eastern half of the United States.  On two separate trips to the Indiana State Library we examined all issues of the Jeffersonville Evening News between June 1928 and December 1929.  We methodically searched through this local newspaper.  Some of the most critical time periods in the construction were viewed multiple times, switching persons in order to make sure more than one person had reviewed these critical time periods.

 We visited the Louisville Public Library’s main branch and made copies of the official Modjeski and Masters engineering report to the bridge commission.  This report provided vital details about the bridge construction and timing which proved very helpful in directing our research on our second trip to the Indiana State Library.

Through this process, we uncovered a tremendous amount of historical evidence related to the Municipal Bridge Construction.  It's taken us over three months to collect and compile the information we are about to present to you in the coming posts.
