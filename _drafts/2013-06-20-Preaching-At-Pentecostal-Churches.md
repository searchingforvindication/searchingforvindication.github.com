_This is the second post in a multi-part series on when Brother Branham became involved with <a href="/tags.html#pentecost-ref">Pentecostal churches</a>._

In our [last post](/2013/06/19/Where-My-Sorrow-Started), we presented Hope's obituary which referred to Brother Branham's church as the Pentecostal Tabernacle.  This concerned us because Brother Branham plainly states that he was a Missionary Baptist at the time the Tabernacle was built and that Hope and Sharon Rose's death was a result of his disobedience to the Lord's call to go out and preach amongst the Pentecostal people.  In this post, we begin examining newspaper articles related to the Tabernacle.

The first article we'd like to share is Charles Branham's obituary.  Charles was Brother Branham's younger brother.  He died in a tragic automobile accident on August 5, 1935.  Here's the article that appeared in the Jeffersonville Evening News the following day:

 Notice that Brother Branham's church is identified as the Branham Tabernacle in 1935.  Was this the original name of the church?  When did the name change to the Pentecostal Tabernacle?  Looking at just this article, it's not clear.  However, this article, combined with Brother Branham's words from _Testimony Of a True Witness_ preached in Jeffersonville, IN on November 5, 1961 do indicate to us that Brother Branham was already preaching amongst the Pentecostals in 1935:

>And this morning while laying on bed thinking of that... The first one to go in our family was my brother Edward. And I was out west working on a ranch when he went. I wasn't home, but I saw him, yet a sinner, saw him in a vision before he went.
 
>The next one to go was Charles. I was... He went quickly, suddenly. He was... I was preaching down here at the little, **colored Pentecostal church that night**, when Charles was killed up on the highway by an automobile.

We can conclude from Brother Branham's own testimony that he was a guest minister at another Pentecostal Church when his brother Charles was killed August 5, 1935 in an automobile accident.  This was almost exactly two years before Hope passed away in July of 1937.  

When Brother Branham's father passed away on November 30, 1936 Brother Branham was identified as the pastor of the Pentecostal Tabernacle.  This event was roughly 8 months before Hope's death.  Here's his father's obituary from the December 1, 1936 Jeffersonville Evening News:

We know that the church was referred to as the Pentecostal Tabernacle in 1936, and that Brother Branham was preaching in Pentecostal churches at least in 1935.  Could Brother Branham have been involved in Pentecostal Churches even earlier?
 
On March 26, 1953 Brother Branham preached a sermon titled _Israel And The Church_ in which he talked about building the tabernacle:

>The big churches made fun and pointed their fingers. They said we were holy-rollers. When I built the--I laid the cornerstone there, they said they'll turn that little old thing into a garage. It's been twenty years ago, and the Holy Ghost still lives here. Hallelujah. That's right. And what they said was fanaticism and everything, kings and monarchs across the world has called. Great men has been healed, the powers of God has swept the world around, till now we stand millions strong. Hallelujah. And one of these mornings... She's went through the critics. They said it would burn out. They said to me down here, said, "Oh, Billy, you lost your mind. That's all there is to it." Even my own mother-in-law said, "Why, the boy's gone crazy." But if I am, I'm having a wonderful time.

In this account, Brother Branham indicates that the people attending the Tabernacle when it was built were referred to as "holy-rollers", the same deragatory term used by his mother-in-law to refer to the Pentecostals he'd met in Mishawaka.  

We decided to step back even further and examine Roy Davis' church since this is where Brother Branham was ordained.  What we found shocked us.
