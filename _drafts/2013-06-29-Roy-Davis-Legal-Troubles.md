_This is the ninth post in a multi-part series on when Brother Branham became involved with <a href="/tags.html#pentecost-ref">Pentecostal churches</a>._

In our [last post](/2013/06/28/History-Of-Roy-Davis-Church) we reviewed the history of when Roy Davis acquired his church in Jeffersonville and when the property was transferred out of his name.  In this post, we examine why Dr. Davis may have left Jeffersonville.

#### Roy Davis Sues To Claim Eaken Estate

The last advertisement for the Pentecostal Baptist Church [appeared in the Jeffersonville Evening News](/2013/06/28/History-Of-Roy-Davis-Church) on February 10, 1934.  Just a short time later, on March 30, 1934, the Jeffersonville Evening News reported that Roy Davis was suing the executor of an estate to set aside the first will of Laura Eaken in favor of a second will that named Davis as the sole beneficiary of her estate.

Remember from our previous post that just a few months after this legal battle, the lot at 328 Watt Street [was transferred from the church to Roy Davis' son](/2013/06/28/History-Of-Roy-Davis-Church).  

#### Scattered Sheep Without a Shepherd

No additional information appears in the newspaper about Roy Davis until July of 1935.  This is consistent with Brother Branham's statements in _Taking Sides With Jesus_ preached in Jeffersonville, Indiana on June 1, 1962:

>And I remember when Brother Roy Davis, down there, and his church burnt down. That bunch of people was just like scattered sheep without a shepherd, had no place to go.

#### Rev. Ulrey Sues Roy Davis

On July 19, 1935 the Jeffersonville Evening News reported that another minister was suing Roy Davis:

The case made news again on August 10, 1935, when a trial date was set.  Notice that Roy Davis is no longer identified as the pastor of the First Pentecostal Baptist church, but rather, as an evangelist holding tent meeting.

Finally, on August 13, 1935, the Jeffersonville Evening News printed this large article on the front page of the paper announcing that Roy Davis had lost his case:

#### Pentecostal Baptist Church Appears Again

The Pentecostal Baptist Church does not appear in the Jeffersonville Evening News From February 10, 1934 until this article ran on November 25, 1935:

The church had additional special meetings on December 6, 1935:

Notice that Roy Davis is not the pastor in these two advertisements.  Also, the address of the church changes between the ads.
